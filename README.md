# camera_cpp

### Use
Just run `make_cam.sh` and you'll get the executable **=)**

### Some details
Source files other than _**main.cpp**_, _**cam.cpp**_ and _**cam.hpp**_ come from the libcamera's Github.\
I can probably take the time later on to rewrite original code that reproduce the same functionnalities, even closer to our needs.
For now, as I am new to libcamera and for a test purpose, this is not my priority.
